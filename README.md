# [Chris Pratt is Now Playing](https://chrisprattisnowplaying.com) by [Aidan Comi](http://aidanc.me)

## Why Create It?
I created [chrisprattisnowplaying.com](https://chrisprattisnowplaying.com) after the news of Chris Pratt voicing both [Mario](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690607/chris-pratt-mario-nintendo-illumination-animated-movie-december-2022-release-date-cast) and [Garfield](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22758214/chris-pratt-garfield-movie-mario). It quickly became a joke across the internet.
## How I Created It
I created the site using JavaScript and HTML. The list of animated Disney characters is from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Disney_animated_universe_characters). It's hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
## Notes
This was quickly built together, it's not perfect and doesn't have every character possible. I will continue to update it as time goes on.
